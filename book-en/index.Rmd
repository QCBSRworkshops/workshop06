# (PART\*) QCBS R Workshop Series {-}

# Preface {-}

The **QCBS R Workshop Series** is a series of 10 workshops that walks participants through the steps required to use R for a wide array of statistical analyses relevant to research in biology and ecology. These open-access workshops were created by members of the QCBS both for members of the QCBS and the larger community.

The content of this workshop has been peer-reviewed by various QCBS members. If you would like to suggest modifications, please contact the current series coordinators, listed on the main Github page.

## Code of conduct

The QCBS R Workshop Series and the QCBS R Symposium are venues dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

Participants, presenters and organizers of the workshop series and other related activities accept this Code of Conduct when being present at any workshop-related activities.

We do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.

We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

It applies to all spaces managed by or affiliated with the workshop, including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all workshop events and platforms:

## Contributing

The QCBS R Workshop Series provides a venue for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to improve their teaching and learning abilities through the instruction and the development of statistical and programming workshops. We immensely value the contributions provided to the series, and we rely on the QCBS community’s engagement to constantly improve our workshops. To encourage community contributions, we keep our workshops openly accessible, reproducible, and encourage collaboration between contributors.

The QCBS offers Learning and Development Awards (LeaDA) to support graduates student and post-doctoral QCBS members who instruct or develop workshops. We also welcome voluntary community feedback to keep the workshops up to date and as helpful as possible!
