# (PART\*) Generalized linear models in `R` {-}

# Learning objectives

A significant limitation of general linear models is that they cannot accommodate response variables that do not have a normal error distribution - a situation that is very common when analyzing biological data. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use **generalized linear models**, which are powerful tools to overcome some of the distributional assumptions of linear models. Especifically, we will:

1. Distinguish generalized linear models from general linear models (including many of their equations!).

2. Identify situations for when the use of generalized linear models is appropriate.

3. Test assumptions for generalized linear models.

4. Implement and execute generalized linear models in binary, proportion and count data.

5. Validate, interprete and visualise results of generalized linear models.

To prepare for this workshop, you must download and install the earliest RStudio and R versions. You must also download the data we will use during this workshop:

-    [Mites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop06/main/book-en/data/mites.csv)
-    [Faramea](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop06/blob/main/book-en/data/faramea.csv)


This workshop requires the following `R` packages:

-    [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) 
-    [MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MASS) 
-    [vcdExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vcdExtra) 
-    [bbmle](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bbmle)
-    [DescTools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DescTools)

To install them from CRAN, run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 
                   'MASS', 
                   'vcdExtra',
                   'bbmle',
                   'DescTools',
                   'GlmSimulatoR',
                   'cplm')
                 )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 
                   'MASS', 
                   'vcdExtra',
                   'bbmle',
                   'DescTools',
                   'GlmSimulatoR',
                   'cplm'),
                 quiet = TRUE)
```


To load these packages, run:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(vcdExtra)
library(bbmle)
library(DescTools)
library(GlmSimulatoR)
library(cplm)
```

This workshop will build up your knowledge on models along side with some of their important equations. *Do not run to the mountains!* This will be achieved progressively and you will feel proud of yourself after!
