# (PART\*) Generalized linear models in `R` {-}

# Learning objectives

**Summary:** A significant limitation of linear models is that they
cannot accommodate response variables that do not have a normal error
distribution. Most biological data do not follow the assumption of
normality. In this workshop, you will learn how to use **generalized**
linear models, which are important tools to overcome the distributional
assumptions of linear models. You will learn the major distributions
used depending on the nature of the response variables, the concept of
the link function, and how to verify assumptions of such models.

*Include learning objectives.*

# Preparing for the workshop

To prepare for this workshop, you must do the following steps:

Download the R script and data required for this workshop:

-    [R Script](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/glmm_e.r)
-    [Mites](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/mites.csv)
-    [Faramea](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/faramea.csv)

Make sure to load the following packages (see how in the R script):

-    [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) 
-    [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lme4) 
-    [MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MASS) 
-    [vcdExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vcdExtra) 
-    [bbmle](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bbmle)
-    [DescTools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DescTools)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lme4")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("vcdExtra")
install.packages("bbmle")
install.packages("DescTools")

library(ggplot2)
library(lme4)
library(MASS)
library(vcdExtra)
library(bbmle)
library(DescTools)
```
