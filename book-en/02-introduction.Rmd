# Why are generalized linear models useful?

To illustrate why generalized linear models are incredibly useful, it is
best to first try to understand the limitations of linear models
(workshop 4), which also include linear mixed effect models (workshop
6). Let's load a dataset and try to fit some linear models.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop")
mites <- read.csv('mites.csv')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
mites <- read.csv('mites.csv')
```

The dataset that you just loaded is a subset of the classic 'Oribatid
mite dataset', which has been used in numerous texts (e.g. Borcard,
Gillet & Legendre, *Numerical Ecology with R*), and which is available
in the \"vegan\" library. The dataset consists of 70 moss and mite
samples collected at University of Montreal's Station de Biologie des
Laurentides, Saint-Hippolyte, QC. Each sample includes measurements for
5 environmental variables and abundance data for 35 mite taxa. In the
reduced dataset that we will be using throughout this workshop, we only
included the 5 environmental measurements and the abundance of a single
mite taxon, \"*Galumna sp.*\" Our goal will be to model the abundance,
occurrence (presence/absence), and proportion of Galumna as a function
of the 5 environmental variables: therefore, we also created a
presence/absence variable and a proportion variable for Galumna.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
head(mites)
str(mites)
```


70 mite communities sampled from moss cores collected at the Station de Biologie des Laurentides, QC.
For each core/sample, the following data is provided:  
**\$Galumna**: abundance of mite genus 'Galumna'  
**\$pa**: presence (1) or absence (0) of Galumna, irrespective of abundance  
**\$totalabund**: total abundance of mites of all species  
**\$prop**: proportion of Galumna in the mite community. i.e. Galumna/totalabund  
**\$SubsDens**: substrate density  
**\$WatrCont**: water content  
**\$Substrate**: type of substrate.  
**\$Shrub**: abundance of shrubs. Coded as a factor.  
**\$Topo**: microtopography. blanket or hummock.  

Can we see any relationship between Galumna and environmental variables?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 7}
plot(mites)
```

There seems to be a negative relationship between Galumna abundance and
water content (WatrCont). Occurence (presence/absence; pa) and
proportion (prop) also seem to be negatively correlated with WatrCont.

We can take a closer look by specifically plotting those 3 response
variables as a function of WatrCont:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.height=3}
par(mfrow=c(1,3), cex = 1) #divide plot area in 1 row and 3 columns to have 3 plots in same figure
plot(Galumna ~ WatrCont, data = mites, xlab = 'Water content', ylab='Abundance')
boxplot(WatrCont ~ pa, data = mites, xlab='Presence/Absence', ylab = 'Water content')
plot(prop ~ WatrCont, data = mites, xlab = 'Water content', ylab='Proportion')
```

Indeed, Galumna seems to vary negatively as a function of WatrCont, i.e.
Galumna seems to prefer dryer sites.

Fit linear models (function 'lm') to test whether these relationships
are statistically significant.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
lm.abund <- lm(Galumna ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
##summary(lm.abund)
lm.pa <- lm(pa ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
##summary(lm.abund)
lm.prop <- lm(prop ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
##summary(lm.abund)

# Extracting the Pr(>|t|)
summary(lm.abund)$coefficients[, 4]

summary(lm.pa)$coefficients[, 4]

summary(lm.prop)$coefficients[, 4]

```

Yes, there is a strong and significant relationship for all 3 response
variables!

Wait a minute... Let's validate these models to make sure that we
respect assumptions of linear models, starting with the abundance model.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align = "center"}
plot(Galumna ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
abline(lm.abund)
```

The model does not fit well. It predicts negative abundance values when
WatrCont exceeds 600, which does not make any sense. Also, the model
does poorly at predicting high abundance values at low values of
WatrCont.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align = "center"}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), cex = 1.4)
plot(lm.abund)
```

Diagnostic plots show that the data/model violate assumptions of
homogeneity of variance (the graph on the left shows that residuals are
larger at higher fitted values) and normality (the graph on the right
indicates that residuals are not distributed as expected from a normal
distribution, i.e. many points are far from predicted values given by
the dotted line). Therefore, we need to reject this model, and can't
use it to conclude that Galumna abundance varies as a function of water
content. Looking at diagnostic plots for the presence-absence model and
the proportion model also indicate that these models are inappropriate:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align = "center"}
#Proportion
plot(prop ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
abline(lm.prop)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), cex = 1.4)
plot(lm.prop)
#Présence/Absence
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), cex = 1.4)
plot(pa ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
abline(lm.pa)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), cex = 1.4)
plot(lm.pa)
```

It is quite common with biological datasets that assumptions of
homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity) and normality are not met.
These two assumptions are the main problem with linear models, and the
main reason why we need generalized linear models. Lets revisit the
basic equation for a linear model to better understand where these
assumptions come from. The equation for a linear model is:

y~i~ = β~0~ + β~1~x~i~ + ε~i~, where:

-   y~i~ is the predicted value for the response variable,
-   β~0~ is the intercept of the regression line between y and x,
-   β~1~ is the slope of the regression line between y and x,
-   x~i~ is the value for the explanatory variable,
-   ε~i~ are the residuals of the model, which are drawn from a normal
    distribution with a varying mean but a constant variance.

This last point about ε~i~ is important. This is where assumptions of
normality and homoscedasticity originate. It means that the residuals
(the distance between each observation and the regression line) can be
predicted by drawing random values from a normal distribution. Recall
that all normal distributions have two parameters, μ (the mean of the
distribution) and σ^2^ (the variance of the distribution):

![](images/6_normal_params.jpeg)

In a linear model, μ changes based on values of x (the predictor
variable), but σ^2^ has the same value for all values of Y. Indeed,
another equation to represent linear models is:

y~i~ \~ *N*(μ = β~0~ + β~1~x~i~, σ^2^),

which literally means that any given observation (y~i~) is drawn from a
normal distribution with parameters μ (which depends on the value of
x~i~) and σ^2^.

Predict Galumna abundance at a water content = 300 using this equation
and the linear model that we fitted earlier. You will need values for
β~0~ and β~1~ (regression coefficients) and ε~i~ (the deviation of
observed values from the regression line)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
coef(lm.abund)
```

This model predicts that for a water content value of, say, 300, we
should obtain a Galumna abundance of 1.63:

3.44 + (-0.006 x 300) = 1.63.

That is the expected abundance if there was no residual. To get our
predicted values, we need to add ε~i~. This is where we use the normal
distribution. For x = 300, our model predicts that ε~i~ should follow a
normal distribution with mean = 1.63. We can find the σ^2^ value for our
abundance model by extracting it from the model summary:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
summary(lm.abund)$sigma
```

We find that sigma is roughly 1.51. We now have all the coefficients
that we need to model Galumna abundance. At a water content of 300,
residuals should follow a normal distribution with parameters μ = 1.63
and σ^2^ = 1.51.

At a water content of 400, residuals ε~i~ should follow a normal
distribution with parameters μ = 3.44 + (-0.006 x 400) = 1.02 and σ^2^ =
1.51, etc. Each y~i~ value is modeled using a different normal
distribution, with a mean that depends on x~i~. The variance of all of
those normal distributions (σ^2^), however, is the same. Function lm()
finds the optimal σ^2^ value that minimizes the total residual sum of
square and uses it for all normal distributions used to model y.
Graphically, this looks like this:

![](images/6_lm_assump.jpeg)

The four normal distributions on this graph represent the probability of
observing a given Galumna abundance for 4 different water content
values. The mean of the normal distribution varies as a function of
water content (hence μ decreases with water content), but σ^2^ is always
1.51 (i.e. the variance is homogeneous across all values of x). This
model is inappropriate for at least two reasons:

1\. Values are on average farther from the regression line at low water
content values. That is, there is more residual variance around the
predicted values for low values of x, such that ε~i~ varies as a
function of x, thus violating the assumption of homoscedasticity. It
makes no sense to use a constant value of σ^2^: the normal distributions
used to predict y at low values of x should ideally be wider (have a
larger σ^2^) than normal distributions used to predict y at large x
values, but linear models do not permit this.

2\. It makes no sense to use a normal distribution to predict y based on
x. Our response variable is abundance, which can only take integer
values. Yet, at water content = 300, the abundance value that our model
predicts to be the most probable is 1.63! We know that the probability
of observing 1.63 individuals at water content = 300 is actually zero,
as is the probability of observing any fraction (non-integers). Our
predicted values should be modeled using a distribution that only
predicts integers, rather than a continuous distribution like the normal
distribution. This is a very common problem, as biological data often
follows one of the myriad other statistical distributions besides the
normal distribution.

Generalized linear models can solve these two problems. Keep reading!
