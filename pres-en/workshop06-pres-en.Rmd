# Preface

### Reviewing linear models

---
# Answering research questions through modelling

Much of our research focuses on investigating how patterns we observe can be explained by predictive variables.

We are often looking for a function $f$ that can explain a response variable ( $Y$ ) *in terms of* one ( $X_1$ ) or many other predictors ( $X_2$, $X_3$, $...$ , $X_n$ ):

$$Y = f(X_1)$$
--
The combination of predictive variables we have sampled will *never* fully explain $Y$. Because of this, there is always *unpredictable disturbance* in our models, i.e. the error $\epsilon$. As such, the error is an irrevocable part of our function:

$$Y = f(X_1, \epsilon)$$
--

In [Workshop 4](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop04/pres-en/workshop04-pres-en.html#1), we have learned how to use **general linear models** as $f(\cdot)$ to describe the relationship between variables. They were:

???

When explaning this slide, provide a few examples of Y and X variables (e.g. number of species, sampling effort, climatic gradient).

X can also be called independent variable, explanatory variable, predictor variabler;

Y can also be called dependent variable, response variable, explained variable, predicted variable;

ϵ can also be called random component, the error term, the disturbance.

# Revisiting linear models

In [Workshop 4](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop04/pres-en/workshop04-pres-en.html#1), we have learned how to use **general linear models** as $f(\cdot)$ to describe the relationship between variables.

The general form of our function $Y = f(X_1)$ as a linear function can be represented by:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \varepsilon_i$$

where:

$Y_i$ is the predicted value of a response variable

$\beta_0$ is the *unknown coefficient* **intercept**

$\beta_1$ is the *unknown coefficient* **slope**

$X_i$ is the value for the explanatory variable

$\varepsilon_i$ is the model residual drawn from a normal distribution with a varying mean but a constant variance.

---
# Revisiting linear models and their assumptions

We have also learned that **linear models** only produce unbiased estimators (i.e. are only reliable) if they follow certain assumptions. Most importantly:

1\. The population can be described by a linear relationship:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \varepsilon$$

2\. The error term $\varepsilon$ has the same variance given any value of the explanatory variable (i.e. homoskedasticity), and the error terms are not correlated across observations (i.e. no autocorrelation):

.pull-left[
$$\mathbb{V}{\rm ar} (\epsilon_i | \mathbf{X} ) = \sigma^2_\epsilon,\ \forall i = 1,..,N$$
]

.pull-right[
$$\mathbb{C}{\rm ov} (\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j) = 0,\ i \neq j$$
]

3\. And, the residuals are normal:

$$\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} | \mathbf{X} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mathbf{0}, \sigma^2_\epsilon \mathbf{I} \right)$$

???

Note that the error and Y are always dependent, thus the Cov(Y, error) is different than zero.

2.  Homoskedasticity and no autocorrelation:


$$\mathbb{V}{\rm ar} (\epsilon_i | \mathbf{X} ) = \sigma^2_\epsilon,\ \forall i = 1,..,N$$
$$\mathbb{C}{\rm ov} (\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j) = 0,\ i \neq j$$

The estimations of general linear models as in $\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 X$ assumes that data is generated following these assumptions.
```{r echo = FALSE}
# Set the coefficients:
N = 50
beta_0 = 1
beta_1 = 0.5
# Generate sample data:
x <- 0:N
#
e <- rnorm(mean = 0, sd = 2, n = length(x))
y <- beta_0 + beta_1 * x + e
# Plot the data
#
#
plot(x, y)

# The unknown DGP:
y_dgp <- beta_0 + beta_1 * x

# Plot the Unknown Population regression:
lines(x = x, y = y_dgp, col = "darkgreen", lty = 2)

legend(x = 0, y = 25,
       legend = c(expression(paste("Y = ", beta[0] + beta[1] * X))),
       lty = c(2, 1), lwd = c(1, 1), pch = c(NA, NA), col = c("darkgreen", "blue"))
```

Note: Improved versions of this workshop should include the lines describing the error estimates, and showing their distribution. For now, the presenter can help participants with this abstraction.

## Representing the assumptions

Let us simulate 250 observational units that satisfy the assumptions we have seen and have $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 2^2), i = 1,...,250$.

.pull-left[

```{r}
nSamples <- 250
ID <- factor(c(seq(1:nSamples)))

simNormData <- data.frame(
  ID = ID,
  PredVar = runif(nSamples, 
                  min = 0, 
                  max = 50),
  RespVar = (2*PredVar + 
               rnorm(nSamples,
                     mean = 0,
                     sd = 2)
             )
  )

# We have learned how to use lm() 

lm.simNormData <- lm(RespVar ~ PredVar, 
                     data = simNormData)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2)) 
plot(lm.simNormData)
```

]

???

Residuals: residual =  observed y   –   model-predicted y

Outliers: observations with large residuals, i.e. the observed value for a point is very different from the one predicted by the regression model.

Leverage points: A leverage point is defined as an observation that has a value of x that is far away from the mean of x. 

Influential observations: An influential observation is defined as an observation that changes the slope of the line. Thus, influential points have a large influence on the fit of the model. One method to find influential points is to compare the fit of the model with and without each observation.

1. Allows one to checkthe assumption of linearity and homoscedasticity;

2. QQ-plot allows the comparison of the residuals to "ideal" normal observations;

3. Scale-location plot (square rooted standardized residual vs. predicted value) is useful for checking the assumption of homoscedasticity;

4. Cook's Distance, which is a measure of the influence of each observation on the regression coefficients.

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \varepsilon$$
It can also be written as this:

$$Y_i \sim N(\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +\varepsilon, \sigma^2)$$

with $N(\cdot)$ meaning that $Y_i$ is drawn from a **normal distribution** with parameters $\mu$ (mean; which depends on $x_i$) and $\sigma$ (variance; which has the same value for all $Y_i$s).

# Model prediction

Remember that we aim at estimating the *unknown coefficients* $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, so that a line effectively predicting every value of $Y$ as a function of $X$ can be drawn!

$$Y_i \sim N(\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +\varepsilon, \sigma^2)$$

We can obtain the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for a normal distribution corresponding to our equation!


To obtain the coefficients from our models, we can use the function `coef()`:

.pull-left[
```{r coefs-lmabund}
coef(lm.abund)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r sigma-lmabund}
summary(lm.abund)$sigma
```

What are the parameters of the normal distribution used to model $Y$ when water content is $300$?

.center[
$\mu = 3.44 + (-0.006 \times 300) = 1.63$   and    $\sigma^2 = 1.51$

i.e. randomly drawn $Y$ values when water content is $300$ should be in average $1.63$ and have variance $1.51$.

At $x = 300$, residuals should follow a normal distribution with $\mu = 1.63$ and $\sigma^2 = 1.51$.

**What are the main problems with this model?**

1. Values are on average farther from the regression line;
2. The estimated $\mu$ (means) are not the same;
3. The estimated $\sigma^2$ (variance) changes;
4. The observations do not fall across the expected values.
]

.pull-right[*1 and 4!*]

???

Perform a multiple choice poll with participants.
Correct answers are 1 and 4.

Values are on average farther from the regression line at low water content values. That is, there is more residual variance around the predicted values for low values of x, such that εi varies as a function of x, thus violating the assumption of homoscedasticity. It makes no sense to use a constant value of σ2: the normal distributions used to predict y at low values of x should ideally be wider (have a larger σ2) than normal distributions used to predict y at large x values, but linear models do not permit this.

## What do we do now? Transform?

Very often, data will not "behave" and will violate the assumptions we have seen, showing evidence for **non-normality** and/or **heteroskedasticity**.

We have been told to **transform** our data using logarithmic, square-root, and cosine transformations.

--

.pull-left[
But, transformations not always work and come with a few drawbacks:

**1.**  They change the response variable (!), making interpretation challenging;  

**2.**  They may not simulateneously improve linearity and homogeneity of variance;  

**3.**  The boundaries of the sample space change.

]

.pull-right[
For instance, our simple linear model:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \varepsilon$$
looks like this under a log-transform:
$$E(\log{Y_i}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i $$

*It seems undesirable to interpret that for every $300$ units increase in water content, Galumna abundance takes the form of $\log(1.63).$*

# Normal distributions are not the only ones!

Statisticians have defined a [multitude of probability distributions](https://www.causascientia.org/math_stat/Dists/Compendium.pdf) to describe different types of data.

A distribution provides the probability of observing each possible outcome of an experiment or survey (e.g. $abund = 8$ *Galumna* individuals).

Distributions can be **discrete** (only include integers), **continuous** (including fractions) and be limited to a given range or domain (e.g., $0$ to $1$, $0$ to $+\infty$, $-\infty$ to $+\infty$).

All distributions can be broken down into **parameters** that dictate their shapes (e.g. $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for the Normal).


---
# Biological data & distributions: Poisson

*Galumna* `abund` follows a discrete distribution (i.e. it only takes integer values).

A useful distribution to model abundance data is the “Poisson” distribution:

- **Poisson** is a discrete distribution with a single parameter, $\lambda$ (lambda), which defines both the mean and the variance of the distribution:

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=15}
x = seq(1, 50, 1)
par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 3), cex = 1.4)
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 1), type = 'h', lwd = 3,
     xlab = 'Frequency of Galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 1')
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 10), type = 'h', lwd = 3,
     xlab = 'Frequency of Galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 10')
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 30), type = 'h', lwd = 3,
     xlab = 'Frequency of Galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 30')
```

- One parameter, $p$, the probability of success.

<br>
```{r,echo=-F,fig.width=12,fig.height=4}
  par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 3), cex=1.4)

  barplot(setNames(c(.1, .9), c('absent (0)', 'present (1)')), ylim = c(0, 1), xlab = 'pa', ylab = 'probability', main = 'p = 0.9')

We can use the Bernouilli distribution to calculate the probability Galumna present (`1`) vs. absent (`0`).

# Biological data & distributions: Binomial

**Binomial distribution**: When there are multiple trials (each with a success/failure), the Bernoulli distribution expands into the binomial distribution.
- Additional parameter, $n$, for number of trials;
- Predicts the probability of observing a given proportion of successes, $p$, out of a known total number of trials, $n$.

# Biological data & distributions: Binomial

**Binomial distribution**: used to model data where the number of successes are integers and where the number of trials, $n$, is known.

**Main difference with Poisson distribution**: the binomial has an upper limit to its range, corresponding to $n$. Consequently, it is right-skewed at low p values but left-skewed at high $p$ values

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
x = seq(1, 50, 1)
par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 2), cex = 1.4)

# Generalized Linear Models

A **generalized linear model** is made of a **linear predictor**:

$$\eta_i = \underbrace{g(\mu)}_{Link~~function}  = \underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1~+~...~+~\beta_pX_p}_{Linear~component}$$
and,

1. a **link** function $g(\mu_i)$ that **transforms the expected value** of $Y$ and describes how the mean $E(Y_i) = \mu_i$ depends on the linear predictor

$$g(\mu_i) = ηi$$

2\. a **variance** function that describows how the variance $\text{var}(Y_i)$ depends on the mean

$$\text{var}(Y_i) = \phi V(\mu)$$
where the **dispersion parameter** $phi$ is a constant.

---
# General linear models as a GLM

So, for our **general linear model** with $\epsilon ∼ N(0, σ^2)$ and $Y_i \sim{} N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$, we have the same linear predictor:


$$\underbrace{g(\mu)}_{Link~~function}  = \underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1~+~...~+~\beta_pX_p}_{Linear~component}$$
the **identity** link function
$$g(\mu_i) = \mu_i$$
and, the variance function

$$V(\mu_i) = 1$$

<br>

.center[*Wow! This is equivalent to the normal linear model that we have learned before!*]

# `glm()`

In `R`, we can fit generalized linear models using the `glm()` function, which is similar to the `lm()` function: 
.pull-left2[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
glm(formula, 
    family = gaussian(link = "identity"), 
    data,
    ...)
``` 
]
.pull-right2[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
lm(formula, 
    data,
    ...)
#
``` 

]

<br>

with the `family` argument taking the names of the **link function** (inside `link`) and, the **variance function**.

This approach is extendable to other distribution families!

# GLM with binomial data: logit link

A **generalized linear model** is made of a **linear predictor**:

$$\underbrace{g(\mu_i)}_{Link~~function}  = \underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1~+~...~+~\beta_pX_p}_{Linear~component}$$
Consider that $Y_i ∼ B(n_i, p_i)$, and that we want to model the proportions of $Y_i^{}/n_i$. As such: 


.center[ 
$E(Y_i^{}/n_i) = p_i$ and $\text{var}(Y_i^{}/n_i) = \frac{1}{n_i}p_i(1-p_i)$
, so that $V(\mu_i) = \mu_i(1-\mu_i)$.]

--
.pull-left[
We first move the probabilities $\mu_i$ to the *odds*:

$$\text{odds}_i = \frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}$$
The odds puts our expected values on a `0` to `+Inf` scale.

]

--

.pull-right[

We then take logarithms, calculating the *logit* or log-odds:

$$\eta_i = \text{logit}(\mu_i) = \log(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i})$$

with $\mu$ being the expected values (probability that $Y = 1$ ), and with the expected values now ranging from `-Inf` to `+Inf`.

]

???

We can understand that as if event A has probability p of occurring, then the odds of event A occurring is the ratio of the probability that A occurs to the probability that A does not occur: p/(1−p).

For example, if the probability that I will fail my courses  is 0.6, the odds that I will fail my courses  is 0.6/(1 − 0.6) = 1.5. This means that the probability of observing a failure in my courses is 1.5 times greater than the probability of not observing it (that is,
1.5 × 0.4 = 0.6).

# Interpreting the `glm()` coefficients

The direct interpretation of the coefficients in the logit model is tenuous because of the link function. If the link is *identity*, it is much easier to interpret.

Let us assume that we have a binary outcome $y$ and two covariates $x_1$ and $x_2$ (and a constant). The probability of a successful outcome ( $y = 1$ ) is given by:

$$Pr(y_i = 1) = p = g^{-1(\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2)}$$

where $g^{-1}()$ is the **inverse link function**.

Now, let us focus in interpreting the $\beta_1$ coefficient.

#### Identity link

For the identity link, the interpretation is straighforward. For one-unit increase in $x_1$, $\beta_1$ dictates a constant difference in the outcome.

$\Delta{y_i} = [\beta_0 + (\color{red}{x_{1i} + 1})\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2] - (\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2)$

$\Delta{y_i} = \beta_1$

---
# Interpreting the `glm()` coefficients

#### Logit link

If a linear logistic model has been used with the two covariates $x_1$ and $x_2$, we have the model:

$$log({\dfrac{p}{1-p}})=\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2$$

for a log odds of a positive response. We may also write that model as follows:

$$\dfrac{p}{1-p}=exp(\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2)$$

$$Pr(yi) = \dfrac{exp(\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2)}{1 + exp{(\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2)}}$$

.center[Great! Do not give up!]

---
# Interpreting the `glm()` coefficients

#### Logit link

Since the inverse link is nonlinear, the coefficient interpretation is difficult.

Let us take a look what happens to the differences for a one-unit change to $x_1$:

$$\Delta{y_i} = \dfrac{\exp[\beta_0 + (\color{red}{x_{1i} + 1})\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2]}{1 + \exp{[\beta_0 + (\color{red}{x_{1i} + 1})\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2]}} - \dfrac{\exp[\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2]}{1 + \exp{[\beta_0 + x_{1i}\beta_1 + x_{2i}\beta_2]}}$$
$$\Delta{y_i} = \exp{(\beta_0)}\{\exp{(\beta_1)}\} $$
As $x$ increases by one unit, the odds increase by a factor of  $\exp(\beta_1)$.

# Predictive power and goodness-of-fit

Recall that the $R^2$ value is a measure of how well the model explains the data.

In simple linear models, $R^2$ can be obtained as the square of the sample correlation equation coefficient ( $r$ ) between the observed outcomes and the predictive values.

In some of the generalized linear models, we take different approaches.

We can obtain a $\text{pseudo-R}^2$, the analogue of the $R^2$ for models fitted by maximum likelihood.

We can calculate McFadden's (1973) $\text{pseudo-R}^2$ in this way:

$$\text{pseudo-R}^2 = \frac{\text{null deviance - residual deviance}}{\text{null deviance}}$$

<br>

> $\text{pseudo-R}^2$ is the variance explained by the model.

---

# Unit deviance, total deviance and null deviance

The unit deviance is a measure of distance between $y$ and $μ$.

$${\displaystyle d(y,y)=0}$$
$${\displaystyle d(y,\mu )>0\quad \forall y\neq \mu }$$

--

The total deviance ${\displaystyle D(\mathbf {y} ,{\hat {\boldsymbol {\mu }}})}$ of a model with predictions ${\hat {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}$ of the observation $\mathbf {y}$ is the sum of its unit deviances:
$${\displaystyle D(\mathbf {y} ,{\hat {\boldsymbol {\mu }}})=\sum _{i}d(y_{i},{\hat {\mu }}_{i})}$$
--

Now, the deviance of a model that has estimates  ${\hat {\mu }}=E[Y|{\hat {\theta }}_{0}]$ can be defined by its **likelihood**:
$$D(y,{\hat {\mu }})=2{\Big (}\log {\big (}p(y\mid {\hat {\theta }}_{s}){\big )}-\log {\big (}p(y\mid {\hat {\theta }}_{0}){\big )}{\Big )}$$
with $\hat \theta_0$ denoting the fitted values of the parameters in the reduced model, while ${\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}_{s}}\hat \theta_s$ denotes the fitted parameters for the saturated model.

---
# Unit deviance, total deviance and null deviance

The **residual deviance** is defined as 2 times the log-likelihood ratio of the full model compared to the reduced model. (The function below is exactly the same as above!)
$$D(y,{\hat {\mu }})=2{\Big (}\log {\big (}p(\text{saturated model}){\big )}-\log {\big (}p(\text{reduced model}){\big )}{\Big )}$$

--

And, the **null deviance** is defined  2 times the log-likelihood ratio of the full model compared to the null model (i.e. predictors are set to 1).

$$D(y,{\hat {\mu }})=2{\Big (}\log {\big (}p(\text{saturated model}){\big )}-\log {\big (}p(\text{null model}){\big )}{\Big )}$$

???

Under some conditions, if the proposed model describes the data nearly as well as the saturated model, then asymptotically D ∼ χ
2 K−p, where K and p are the number of parameters in the saturated and proposed models, respectively. If the proposed model is poor, D will be larger than predicted by the χ2 K−p distribution.

---
# Total deviance and null deviance

In `R`, we can do this as follows:

Let us compare the deviance of your model (residual deviance) to the deviance of a null model (null deviance).

--

The **null deviance model** here is a model without explanatory variables.

```r
null.model <- glm(response.variable ~ 1, family = binomial)
```

--

# Predictive power and goodness-of-fit

An adjusted McFadden's pseudo-R2, which penalizes for the number of predictors, can be calculated as below:
.pull-left[
\begin{equation}
R^2_{adj} = 1 - \frac{logL(M) - K}{logL(M_{null})}
\end{equation}
]

.pull-right[
where $K$ corresponds to the additional number of predictors in relation to the null model.
]

The goodness-of-fit of logistic regression models can be expressed by variants of pseudo-R2 statistics, such as Maddala (1983) or Cragg and Uhler (1970) measures.

When talking about *logistic regressions*, low $R^2$ values are often common.

### Exercise 2: Performing a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test

One way to assess the goodness-of-fit of these models is to use the **Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test**.

It roughly involves:
1. Dividing the data into groups of similar size;
2. Ordering on the predicted probability (or equivalently, the linear predictor);
3. Comparing the observed to expected number of positive responses in each group;
4. Performing a chi-squared test on the outcome.

This test is assessing whether or not the observed event rates match expected event rates in subgroups of the model population.

# Proportion data and GLM

Sometimes, proportion data are more similar to logistic regression than you think...

In discrete counts, we can, for instance, measure the number of presence of individuals in relation to the total number of populations sampled.

We will thus obtain a proportional number of "success" in observing individuals by dividing the counts by the total counts.

> In `glm()`, we have to provide *prior weights* if the response variable is the proportion of successes.

---
# Proportion data and GLM

Proportions can be modeled by providing both the number of "successes" and *prior weights* in the function

                data = mites,
                family = binomial)
```

The weights can also be set explicitly in `glm()`
```{r}

                 data = mites,

# The Poisson distribution

The Poisson distribution specifies the probability of a discrete random variable $Y$ and is given by:

$$f(y, \,\mu)\, =\, Pr(Y = y)\, =\, \frac{\mu^y \times e^{-\mu}}{y!}$$

$$E(Y)\, =\, Var(Y)\, =\, \mu$$

**Properties**:

- $\mu$ is the parameter of the Poisson distribution;
- specifies the probably only for integer values;
- probability for negative values is null ( $P(Y<0) = 0$ );
- $Var(Y) = \mu$ (allows for heterogeneity).

---
# Poisson GLM behind the scenes

A Poisson GLM will model the value of $\mu$ as a function of different explanatory variables.

<br>

.center[**Three steps**]


**Step 1.** We assume $Y_i$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean and variance $\mu_i$.

$$Y_i ∼ Poisson(\mu_i)$$

$$E(Y_i) = Var(Y_i) = \mu_i$$

$$f(y_i, \, \mu_i) = \frac{\mu^{y_i}_i \times e^{-\mu_i}}{y!}$$

$\mu_i$ corresponds to the expected number of individuals

---
# Poisson GLM behind the scenes

**Step 2.** We specify the systematic part of the model just as in a linear model.

$$\underbrace{\alpha}_\text{Intercept} + \underbrace{\beta_1}_\text{slope of 'Elevation'} \times \text{Elevation}_i + \underbrace{\beta_2}_\text{slope of 'Precipitation'} \times \text{Precipitation}_i$$

**Step 3.** The link between the mean of $Y_i$ and the systematic part is a logarithmic function can be written as:

$$log(\mu_i) = \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{Elevation}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{Precipitation}_i$$
.pull-left[
.center[or]

$$\mu_i = e^{ \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{Elevation}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{Precipitation}_i}$$

.center[or]

$$\mu_i = e^{\alpha} \times e^{\beta_1^{\text{Elevation}_i}} \times e^{\beta_2^{\text{Precipitation}_i}}$$

]
.small[
This shows that the impact of each explanatory variable is multiplicative.
Increasing Elevation by one increases μ by factor of exp( $\beta_\text{Elevation}$ ).

If $βj = 0$ then $exp(βj) = 1$ and $μ$ is not related to $x_j$. If $βj > 0$ then $μ$ increases if $x_j$ increases; if $βj < 0$ then $μ$ decreases if $x_j$ increases.

# Fitting a Poisson GLM in `R`

The function `glm()` allows you to specify a Poisson GLM.

```{r}
glm.poisson = glm(Faramea.occidentalis ~ Elevation,
                  data = faramea, family = poisson)
```

The `family` argument specifies the distribution and link function.

<br>

As with `lm()` you can access the outputs of the model using the function `summary()`:

```{r, eval=F}
summary(glm.poisson)
```

]

???

Note: Point out that the resiudal deviance of 388.12 is much higher than residual degrees of freedom of 41 indicating overdispersion.

---

# Parameter estimates

In our model the unknown parameters are the intercept ( $\alpha$ ) and the slope of elevation ( $\beta$ ):


$$log(\mu_i) = 1.769 - 0.0027 \times \text{Elevation}_i$$

.center[or]

$$\mu_i = e^{1.769 - 0.0027 \times \text{Elevation}_i}$$


---

# The deviance

Remember that to estimate the unknown parameter maximum likelihood estimation is used.

The residual deviance is defined as twice the difference between the log-likelihood of a model that provides a perfect fit and the log-likelihood of our model.

$$\text{residual deviance} = 2 \, log(L(y;\,y)) - 2 \, log(L(y;\, \mu))$$

In a Poisson GLM, the residual deviance should be close to the residual degrees of freedoms.


.center[.alert[388.12 >> 41]]

>Our residual deviance is much higher than the degrees of freedom of our model!

---
# Overdispersion

For a Poisson distribution, $var[y] = μ$. However, in practice the apparent
variance of the data often exceeds $μ$, reflecting *overdispersion* in the model parameters.

<br>

Overdispersion arises because the mean $μ$ innately varies,
even when all the explanatory variables are fixed, or because the
events that are being counted are positively correlated.

<br>

.center[*Are you able to think of a situation in biology that can cause overdispersion?*]

<br>

**Why should we care about overdispersion?**

>Tests on the explanatory variables will generally appear to be more significant and confidence intervals for the parameters will be narrower
than warranted by the data!

---

# Overdispersion

When the residual deviance is higher than the residual degrees of freedom we say that the model is **overdispersed**. We can calculate a overdispersion parameter ( $\phi$ ):

$$\phi \, = \, \frac{\text{Residual deviance}}{\text{Residual degrees of freedom}}$$

Since the Poisson GLM assumes that $var[y] = μ$, we will need to find an alternative.


.center[.large[**Solutions**]]

# Quasi-Poisson GLM

The variance of the distribution will account for **overdispersion**:

$$E(Y_i) = \mu_i$$

$$Var(Y_I) = \phi \times \mu_i$$

where $\phi$ (*phi*) is the dispersion parameter.

The **systematic part** and the **link function** remain the same.

Correcting for overdispersion will not affect parameter estimates, but will affect their **significance**. Further, the standard errors of the parameters are multiplied by $\sqrt{\phi}$.

# Dispersion parameter

A quasi-Poisson GLM can correct for some overdispersion but if too high a different distribution might be better
---
# Negative binomial GLM

Negative binomial GLMs are favoured when overdispersion is high:

- It has **two parameters** $\mu$ and $k$, where $k$ controls for the dispersion parameter (smaller $k$ indicates higher dispersion);
- It corresponds to a combination of two distributions (**Poisson** and **Gamma**);
- It assumes that the $Y_i$ are Poisson distributed with the mean $\mu$ assumed to follow a Gamma distribution!

The predicted values follow as:

$$E(Y_i) = \mu_i$$
and the variance function:

$$Var(Y_i) = \mu_i + \frac{\mu^2_i}{k}$$

- **Log-normal distribution in glm**, avoids having to log-transform the data.
- **Gamma distribution**. Similar to log-normal, more versatile.
- **Tweedie distribution**. Versatile family of distributions. Useful for data with a mix of zeros and positive values (not necessarily counts).
- **Zero-inflated Poisson or zero-inflated negative binomial**. When the data comprise an excess number of zeros, that arise from a different process than the process that generates the counts.
